Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied
where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a
small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele.

*Use case:* Managing effective in-store compliance, health & safety, and employee checks and procedures.
