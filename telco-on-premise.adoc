5G is the latest evolution of wireless mobile technology. It can deliver a number of services from the network edge:

* Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)
** 5G enhances data speeds and experiences with new radio capabilities like mmWave frequency spectrum for higher
bandwidth allocation and theoretical throughput up to 20Gbps.
* Ultra-reliable, low-latency communication (uRLLC)
** 5G supports vertical industry requirements, including sub-millisecond latency with
less than 1 lost packet in 105 packets.
* Massive machine type communications (mMTC)
** 5G supports cost-efficient and robust connection for up to 1 million mMTC, NB-IOT, and LTE-M devices per square
kilometer without network overloading.

*Use case:* Ultra-reliable, immersive experiences for people and objects when and where it matters most.

== The technology

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. It
provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat AMQ Streams* is a massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on
the Apache Kafka project. It offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share
data with high throughput and low latency.

** *Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform* is a foundation for building and operating automation across an organization.
The platform includes all the tools needed to implement enterprise-wide automation.

** *Red Hat Smart Management* combines the flexible and powerful infrastructure management capabilities with the
ability to execute remediation plans. It helps you more securely manage any environment supported by Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, from physical machines to hybrid multiclouds.

** *Red Hat Quay* is a private container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images. It analyzes your
images for security vulnerabilities, identifying potential issues that can help you mitigate security risks.

** *Red Hat Identity Management* provides a centralized and unified way to manage identity stores, authentication,
policies, and authorization policies in a Linux-based domain.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations* is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

*Dedicated Cluster*: The purpose of the dedicated cluster is to provide resources to the applications and the tools
for the service provider to manage these applications. Containerized 5GC applications can be deployed by the service
providers on-premise in their own datacenters on a horizontal cloud platform. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is
well-suited for this purpose, supporting multiple applications from different vendors on the same infrastructure. It
can be deployed on bare metal on top of certified hardware with a network underlay of the operator’s choosing. It also
offers several options for integrated overlay networks, including Open vSwitch-based software-defined network (SDN) and
third-party SDNs using Container Network Interface (CNI). Red Hat OpenShift also provides access to shared storage with
Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation or, alternatively, through supported third-party enterprise storage solutions that
can be plugged in using Container Storage Interface (CSI).

*Cloud Native Components*: Each OpenShift-based cluster provides components that are used by the applications or the
service provider teams for Day 0, Day 1, and Day 2 operational tasks. They include:

* Kubernetes operators for life-cycle management of the platform and platform services. Application vendors may also
provide operators for managing their application products.

* Service assurance tools for logging and monitoring, which can be integrated with existing operations systems to
provide visibility into the functioning of the platform and applications.

* OpenShift Service Mesh for service discovery and exposure, and as a mechanism for specialized network handling,
certificate management, etc.

* Integrated networking and storage interfaces providing access to the corresponding resources.

* Cluster console to provide visibility into an individual cluster configuration and status and the details of its
workloads.

*5G Core Functions*: 5G Core follows the control and user plane separation (CUPS) strategy that was introduced in 3GPP
Release 14. CUPS decouples control and user plane functions, enabling data forwarding components to be decentralized.

* User Plane Function (UPF) is responsible for packet processing and traffic aggregation of user traffic. Since this
functionality is decoupled from the control component, it can be placed closer to the network edge near the end user
or device, increasing bandwidth efficiencies and resulting in higher data rates and lower latencies.

* Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and Session Management Function (SMF) are part of the control plane.
AMF is responsible for handling connections and mobility management tasks while SMF handles session management. AMF
receives connection and session-related info from the end devices, passing the session info to SMF, which establishes
sessions by using UPF.

* Policy Control Function (PCF) provides a framework for creating policies to be consumed by the other control plane
network functions. Examples include policies for QoS, network slicing management, and subscribers, applications, and
network resources management.

* Authentication Server Function (AUSF) provides authentication and Unified Data Management (UDM) ensuring user
identification, authorization and subscription management.

*5G Supplementary Functions*:

* Network Repository Function (NRF) is used by AMF to select the correct SMF out of the available pool.

* NRF and Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF) work together to support network slicing capabilities. 

* Network Exposure Function (NEF) exposes 5G services and resources so third-party apps can more securely access 5G
services.

* Application Function (AF) exposes an application layer for interacting with 5G network resources, retrieving resource
info from PCF and exposing them.

*5G Management Funtion*: Most complex telco applications, such as 5GC, include their own management component
responsible for the application’s life cycle: provisioning, configuration, scaling, updates, etc. This component would
be application-specific, and depending on the vendor implementation, would interact with the platform and the
application over open or proprietary API interfaces. This component is optional and its functionality might be rolled
into the Orchestrator or implemented using Operators.

*Shared Services*: Common cluster-external services can be shared across multiple clusters and are not
application-specific. They provide such things as shared storage, underlay networking, container image repositories
for platform and application images, DevOps or GitOps pipelines, and automation tools.

*External Services*: Common datacenter services applicable to network applications running on cloud platforms would
include Domain Name Service (DNS), identity management, and Network Time Protocol (NTP).

*External Network Infrastructure*: This component of the solution stack includes key network infrastructure
capabilities such as security, load balancing and datacenter fabric.

*Management and Application Orchestration*: Management and orchestration allows dynamic scaling of end-to-end 5G
solution, across multiple clusters with automation.
