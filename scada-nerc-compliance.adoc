This Portfolio Architecture targets energy providers in North America that need to be compliant with NERC regulations and in order to achieve this they decide to modernize the interfaces between their business applications and their SCADA systems also for a better consumption of information that can be used in combination with AI/ML and decision management tools to better address customer needs. 

Use case: Provide interfaces with SCADA systems that are compliant with NERC regulations, creating different layers of API gateways to protect business service depending on the network zones.
