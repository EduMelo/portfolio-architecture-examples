This architecture covers the use case around edge medical diagnosis in the healthcare industry.

*Use case:* Accelerating medical diagnosis using condition detection in medical imagery with AI/ML at medical facilities.

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management* for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with
built-in security policies. Extend the value of Red Hat OpenShift by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and
enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Serverless* helps developers to build, deploy and run event-driven applications that will start
based on an event trigger, scale up resources as needed, then scale to zero after resource burst.

** *Red Hat AMQ Streams* is a massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on
the Apache Kafka project. It offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share
data with high throughput and low latency.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations* is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science* is a managed cloud service for data scientists and developers of intelligent
applications. It provides a fully supported sandbox in which to rapidly develop, train, and test machine learning (ML)
models in the public cloud before deploying in production.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.


== Edge medical diagnosis overview

* This is an overview look at edge medical diagnosis, providing the solution details and the elements described above
in both a network and data centric view:

** The overview splits the solution into two distinct locations; the diagnostic facility where the medical staff and
the edge x-ray devices are located and the medical data center where development and monitoring of the solution takes
place.

** Initial images are sent into the diagnostic facility image receiver and registering an event to start the processing
for automated diagnosis. These images are stored locally, anonymized, and automatically evaluated for possible
disease detection. A notification is generated for the medical staff, either automated detection, non-detection, or
an edge case needing qualified medical staff review.

** In the process of image capture and processing, the images are sent back to the medical data center to be added
to the collection used for model training and development. The applications, machine learning models, data science
development and dashboards for monitoring the processes are all in constant evolution. Developers and operations
teams are maintaining code and infrastructure manifests for full GitOps deployment of the architectural elements.

== Edge medical diagnosis with GitOps

* GitOps delivery and development are essential to a fully automated cloud hosted solution:

** This schematic diagram features the elements focusing only on development and deployment of the edge medical
diagnosis elements needed for this solution. It removes the patient facing medial staff and the edge image
capturing, instead featuring developer and IT operations staff on the back end.

** In the medical data center developers deliver code projects into the CI/CD pipelines and trigger eventual container
image builds put into the registry. The same is happening on the IT operations side, where system configuration and
manifest code is maintained in their repository.

** The developer image registry is replicated out to the image registry in the remote diagnostic facility and the
source code repository for IT operations is also replicated out to the remote location. These both are setup to
trigger the GitOps pipelines to sync updates to the image registry and the operations source code repository to the
OpenShift platform. This means it's deploying, configuring, and applying manifests to the applications and services
used to process the medical diagnosis imaging solution.
