5G is the latest evolution of wireless mobile technology. It can deliver a number of services from the network edge:

* Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)
** 5G enhances data speeds and experiences with new radio capabilities like mmWave frequency spectrum for higher bandwidth allocation and theoretical throughput up to 20Gbps.
* Ultra-reliable, low-latency communication (uRLLC)
** 5G supports vertical industry requirements, including sub-millisecond latency with
less than 1 lost packet in 105 packets.
* Massive machine type communications (mMTC)
** 5G supports cost-efficient and robust connection for up to 1 million mMTC, NB-IOT, and LTE-M devices per square kilometer without network overloading.

*Use case:* Build an adaptable, on-demand infrastructure services for 5G Core that can deliver across diverse use
cases with minimal CAPEX and OPEX.

== The technology

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. It
provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform* is a foundation for building and operating automation across an organization.
The platform includes all the tools needed to implement enterprise-wide automation.

** *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management* for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with
built-in security policies. Extend the value of Red Hat OpenShift by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and
enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale.

** *Red Hat Identity Management* provides a centralized and unified way to manage identity stores, authentication,
policies, and authorization policies in a Linux-based domain.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations* is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

*Infrastructure*: The infrastrusture includes core services like; compute , network , storage , infrastructure
sub-utilities (ex ntp source), additive network functions (ex firewall / load balancers etc) as well as add-on software
services such as identity management, infrastructure automation toolbox and base image catalogs.

*Application Platform*: Application platform is the core “engine” that runs the 5G application. The key components
provided such as container execution and orchestration platform, application sub-utilities (dashboards, apis, pluggable
resources etc) , additive devops and platform-management toolboxes. Application platform is not necessarily a singleton
instance but a distributed highly available, resilient open source software stack.

*Applications*: 5G applications can be sub-categorized into:

* Main functions that deliver 3GPP 5G Core functionality for device/user registration and session management.
* Supplementary functions that deliver device/user subscription and value added services.
* Management function(s) deliver operations support system (oss) and business support systems (bss) duties.

*Platform Management and Application Orchestration*: The best practice, to achieve smooth and consistent platform
creation, management as well as application stack delivery, is leveraging the GitOps pattern. Using git as a single
source of truth, both for platform configurations as well as application/function stacks, is the only way to achieve
homogeneous and scalable 5G Core across on-premise and hyperscalers.
