Modern application infrastructure has, in many ways, gotten more complex as it has become more powerful and easy to consume.
Keeping that infrastructure safe and compliant is a challenge for many organizations. One of the most powerful approaches to 
infrastructure management today is the combination of using historical data-driven insights, and automation tools for applying 
remediation across a scaling estate of hosts in a targeted and prioritized manner.

Use case: Managing security, policy and patches for a large number of servers in data centers or public/private clouds.
