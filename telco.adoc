5G is the latest evolution of wireless mobile technology. It can deliver a number of services from the network edge:

- Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)
* 5G enhances data speeds and experiences with new radio capabilities like mmWave frequency spectrum for higher bandwidth allocation and theoretical throughput up to 20Gbps.
- Ultra-reliable, low-latency communication (uRLLC)
* 5G supports vertical industry requirements, including sub-millisecond latency with
less than 1 lost packet in 105 packets.
- Massive machine type communications (mMTC)
* 5G supports cost-efficient and robust connection for up to 1 million mMTC, NB-IOT, and LTE-M devices per square kilometer without network overloading.

This document is a collection of various architectures in the telco domain. Each case is detailed below with a definition of the 
use case along with logical, schematic, and detailed diagrams.


= Telco 5G Core

Use case: Enabling ultra-reliable, immersive telco experiences through 5G for people and objects when and where it matters most.
