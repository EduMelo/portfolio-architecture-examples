Financial services institutions understand that todayâ€™s banking customers expect fast, easy-to-use services they
can tap into anytime, anywhere, and are therefore accelerating adoption of digital technologies to enable a variety
of new offerings. 


== Payments

Use case: Financial institutions enabling customers with fast, easy to use, and safe payment services available anytime, anywhere... 

An offering of (near) real-time payments lets businesses, consumers, and even governments send and accept funds that 
provide both availability to the recipient and instant confirmation to the sender. Enabling real-time - or at least 
faster - payments that improve the speed of online payment experiences to customers has the potential to give 
banks a greater opportunity to win, serve, and retain their customers. By building solutions that capture real-time 
payment business, banks also can drive higher payment volumes, ideally at lower costs as well as engage new customer 
segments.
