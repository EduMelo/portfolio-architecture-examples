Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit.
Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied where a service provider fills
the small orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or
government clientele. Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products. Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods,
including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often
involves window shopping and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.

This blueprint covers several architectures in the retail domain; supply chain integration, point of sale, headless eCommerce,
business optimisation, store health and safety, real-time stock control, and retail data framework. Each case is detailed below 
with short outline of the case definition along with logical, schematic, and detailed diagrams.
