This architecture covers the use case around using payments architecture in the financial services domain. An offering
of (near) real-time payments lets businesses, consumers, and even governments send and accept funds that provide both
availability to the recipient and instant confirmation to the sender. Enabling real-time - or at least faster - payments
that improve the speed of online payment experiences to customers has the potential to give banks a greater opportunity
to win, serve, and retain their customers. By building solutions that capture real-time payment business, banks also
can drive higher payment volumes, ideally at lower costs as well as engage new customer segments.

*Use case:* Financial institutions enabling customers with fast, easy to use, and safe payment services available
anytime, anywhere.
