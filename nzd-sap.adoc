This architecture covers Near Zero Downtime Maintenance for RHEL servers hosting SAP workloads. SAP workloads are
critical in the company and the maintenance windows are very strict, sometimes making it difficult for the system
administrators to finish the update tasks properly in time. This solution allows for application of OS patches, fixes,
updates, DB patches and new versions and SAP kernel updates while users can continue to work inside SAP, not perceiving
any disruption.

*Use case:* Minimizing the downtime of the maintenances on SAP hosts so that users and processes can continue to work
without perceiving any interruption.

== The technology

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions* is combining an intelligent operating system with predictive management
tools and SAP-specific content, Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions provides a single, consistent, highly
available foundation for business-critical SAP and non-SAP workloads.

*Red Hat Satellite* the smart management element in this architecture, used for tracking, managing, auditing, and
collecting data on the entire infrastructure to ensure that baselines are met.

** *Red Hat Smart Management*, which includes Satellite and Cloud Connector, provides the capability to gather
anonymized configuration information from the SAP hosts and send that anonymized data to Insights Platform (on Red
Hat’s SaaS). Satellite manages the lifecycle of the SAP servers, applying the packages, security fixes, etc., that
they need to be compliant with SAP’s and Red Hat’s recommendations and consistent between them.

** *Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform* is the framework used in this solution to run the remediation Ansible
playbooks in the hosts that will correct the situations that could lead to a failure or issue, for example modifying
a kernel memory parameter that can cause a bad performance of the SAP HANA DB or applying a certain level of an OS
package that is needed for a particular version of SAP Netweaver.
