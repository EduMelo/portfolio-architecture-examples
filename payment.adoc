Financial services institutions understand that todayâ€™s banking customers expect fast, easy-to-use services they
can tap into anytime, anywhere, and are therefore accelerating adoption of digital technologies to enable a variety
of new offerings. That often includes real-time payments that let businesses, consumers, and even governments send
and accept funds that provide both availability to the recipient and instant confirmation to the sender. Enabling
real-time - or at least faster - payments that improve the speed of online payment experiences to customers has
the potential to give banks a greater opportunity to win, serve, and retain their customers. By building solutions
that capture real-time payment business, banks also can drive higher payment volumes, ideally at lower costs as
well as engage new customer segments.
