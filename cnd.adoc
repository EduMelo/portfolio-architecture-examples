Cloud-native development is an approach to building and running applications to fully use the advan- tages of the cloud computing model (i.e., responsive, elastic, and resilient applications). Red Hat empowers organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.

Containers and orchestration, DevOps and continuous delivery, microservices and service meshes, and declarative application programming interfaces (APIs) are key building blocks of cloud-native application development. These technologies and techniques deliver loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow businesses to make high-impact application improvements frequently and predictably with minimal effort and risk. Additionally, cloud-native architecture and technologies provide the foundation for newer devel- opment models such as serverless computing and Functions-as-a-Service.
