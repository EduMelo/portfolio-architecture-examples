An omnichannel approach provides a unified customer experience across platforms, creating a single view for customers to
interact with their own information. Red Hat provides a foundation for IT teams to develop and deliver omnichannel
services through a combination of integration and process automation technologies. Agile integration defines how
organizations are transforming and delivering on their digital promise to customers by integrating applications and
services across on-premise infrastructure and cloud environments. Business automation, in the form of process
integrations, are captured to enable access to complex process services.

*Use case:* Omnichannel implies integration and orchestration of channels such that the experience of engaging across
all the channels someone chooses to use.

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Runtimes* helps organizations use the cloud delivery model and simplify continuous delivery of applications, the cloud-native way. Built on proven open source technologies, it also provides development teams multiple modernization options to enable a smooth transition to the cloud for existing applications.

** *Red Hat 3scale API Management* makes it easy to manage your APIs. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize your APIs on an infrastructure platform built for performance, customer control, and future growth.

** *Red Hat Business Automation* is an application development platform that enables developers and business experts to create cloud-native applications that automate business operations.

** *Red Hat Integration* is a comprehensive set of integration and messaging technologies to connect applications and data across hybrid infrastructures.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations* is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.


== Process integration example
--

--

Example of a process application deployed in a mobile applications making calls through the API Gateway to leverage
both Frontend Microservices and Process Facade Microservices to access functionality in the Process Server and
integration with backend systems through the Integration Microservices. Container Native Storage shown used for process
storage as an example. Not showing monitoring.

== Mobile integration example
--

--

Example of a mobile application making calls through the API Gateway to leverage both Frontend Microservices and Mobile
Services to serve data to the device and integration with backend systems through the Integration Microservices.
Container Native Storage shown as the data source for mobile data consumption in this example for simplicity.

== Integration service example
--

--

Example use of integration microservices with web ui making calls through the API Gateway to leverage Frontend
Microservices that in turn call to various integration with backend systems through an Integration Microservice. SSO
server shown with integration to existing company backend Active Directory Server for authentication. Not showing
monitoring.

== Integration data service example
--

--

Example use of integration microservices with web ui making calls through the API Gateway to leverage Frontend
Microservices that in turn call to various integration with a customer contact database through an Integration Data
Microservice. SSO server shown with integration to existing company backend Active Directory Server for authentication.
Not showing monitoring.

== Process integration with third-party
