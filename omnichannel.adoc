An omnichannel approach provides a unified customer experience across platforms, creating a single view for
customers to interact with their own information.

Red Hat provides a foundation for IT teams to develop and deliver omnichannel services through a combination
of integration and process automation technologies. Agile integration defines how organizations are transforming
and delivering on their digital promise to customers by integrating applications and services across on-premise
infrastructure and cloud environments. Business automation, in the form of process integrations, are captured to
enable access to complex process services.

Use case: Omnichannel implies integration and orchestration of channels such that the experience of engaging across
all the channels someone chooses to use.
