This blueprint covers the architecture for cloud adoption. As enterprises adopt to public and/or private clouds, it is important to provide automation to manage and scale server deployments and to provide the capability to transition servers between data centers and cloud providers. This provides flexibility and portability.

The diagrams include the logical, schematic, and detailed diagrams.
