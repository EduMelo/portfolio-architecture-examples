This architecture covers the use case around data center to edge where the energy (utility) infrastructure companies
operate across vast geographical area that connects the upstream drilling operations with downstream fuel processing
and delivery to customers. These companies need to monitor the condition of pipeline and other infrastructure for
operational safety and optimization.

*Use case:* Bringing computing closer to the edge by monitoring for potential issues with gas pipeline (edge).
